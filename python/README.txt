Notes on the challenge:

Using tweepy.Curser to find 3200 of kanye's latest tweets only returned around 1766 (did he have his account deleted??)
Oddly, it was able to return 3200 elon tweets with no issues.
Due to a time crunch, I was not able to trouble shoot this bug.

Filtering the tweets by finding substrings was not the most efficient way to filter (takes a while to load tweets)

Thank you for a fun challenge, I know my style in python is not the best since I've only used it in very basic settings.
